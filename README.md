# Economic-Growth-and-Debt-Analysis-
An empirical analysis of the impact of the 1980s oil crisis on economic growth and debt in Latin American countries. The project uses econometric techniques to explore the relationship between GDP growth, debt, and other macroeconomic variables, focusing on oil-importing and oil-exporting countries.

## Introduction
The 1980s oil crisis had a significant impact on Latin American economies, particularly on oil-importing and oil-exporting countries. This project aims to analyze how the crisis affected GDP growth and debt levels in these countries.

## Motivation
The 1973 oil embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) had long-lasting effects on Latin American economies. This project seeks to understand how the crisis influenced economic growth and debt in oil-importing and oil-exporting countries.

## Data
The dataset includes macroeconomic variables for 10 Latin American countries from 1980 to 2018. Variables include GDP growth, debt, trade, tax revenue, labor force growth, and more. Data is sourced from the World Development Indicators.

## Methodology
The analysis uses econometric techniques, including:
- **Regression Analysis**: Pooled OLS, WLS, Fixed Effects (FE), and Random Effects (RE) models.
- **Robustness Analysis**: Outlier detection, heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, and autocorrelation tests.
- **Instrumental Variable (IV) Analysis**: To address endogeneity issues.

## Results
Key findings include:
- **Gross Fixed Capital Formation** and **Oil Trader Category** have a positive relationship with GDP growth.
- **Government Consumption** has a negative relationship with GDP growth.
- Net oil-importing countries experienced higher GDP growth compared to net oil-exporting countries after the crisis.

## Conclusion
The 1980s oil crisis had a significant impact on Latin American economies, with net oil-importing countries recovering faster than net oil-exporting countries. The study highlights the importance of macroeconomic stability and the role of debt in economic growth.
